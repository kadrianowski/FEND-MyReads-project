# About the Project

This game was built for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Start from scratch and Create React App or use a starter code from Udacity

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

If you feel no need for setting up your own project, use [this starting repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server for fetching Books

To simplify my development process, Udacity provided a backend server for me to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods I needed to perform necessary operations on the backend

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Special Thanks
This wouldn't be possible without StackOverflow, great people of internet and Headspace meditation app.
